<h1>Hello world</h1>
<p>These are personal tests that aren't ready to be published, but I wanted to show some things I've worked on.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="collapsing-layouts.html">Collapsing layouts</a></li>
    <li><a href="collisions.html">Collisions</a></li>
    <li><a href="sticky.html">Sticky Nav + Sidebar jQuery Plugin</a> - This code is horribly unorganized.  I hacked it together and haven't had the time to refactor!</li>
    <li><a href="debug.js">Debug.js: A Backbone.js based JavaScript debugger</a> - The state of this is uncertain.  It worked at one time,
    however I haven't looked at this in a few months.</li>
    <li><a href="guides.js">guides.js</a> - These are pixel guides to help you line things up.  Great for mobile dev.</li>
    <li><a href="boxMath.js">boxMath.js</a> - This library helps compute tricky box model math, giving you the x/y positions of the margin box, border box, padding box, and content box.</li>
    <li><a href="item.module.js">item.module.js</a> - This is some more JavaScript that I've tinkered with.  It's all part of a learning process, and by no means production ready.</li>
</ul>
